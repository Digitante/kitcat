# KitCAT
Kit for Creative Arts Teamwork: a Qt-based client for TACTIC, with free-software application plugin integration.

This is a Python package to contain the PySide/Qt GUI application source, and plugins for various applications, starting with Blender.

Since several applications support Python scripting, we will prefer that as a basis for plugins, and provide some common features in a shared plugin-helper library. This should provide some of general code for context-collection and passing the context to the GUI client.

Hopefully this readme will get more useful as we add code to this project!
